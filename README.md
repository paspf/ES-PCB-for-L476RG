The boad was developed for teaching purposes in the embedded systems laboratory. It is connected to the ST-MORPHO connectors on the Nucleo L476RG. It adds 8 LEDs, two buttons, four WS2812b LEDs and a display to the Nucleo. This git contains all KiCad files of the project. In the release section you can find the corresponding gerber files.
